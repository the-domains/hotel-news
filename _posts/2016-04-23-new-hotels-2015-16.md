# New Hotels 2015 / 16

# In today's post, I will share my collated findings on "New" Hotels over the last 3 years. Whilst these are my best endeavours to track the information, sadly there are possible gaps in the analysis. I do hope that the information will give my readers an overview of the trends in the hospitality industry.I am going to focus on 4 areas of interest with regards to the changes in the hospitality industry.

1. Conversions
2. New Builds
3. Rebrandings
4. Other Hotel Announcements

## Conversions:

# These are new hotels which are being brought online. The developers are re-tasking a previous building into a hotel. I am not tracking the original building, but a couple of examples come to mind:

1. [Malmaison Hotel in Oxford][0]-- which used to be Oxford Jail.
2. **[_**Mondrian London at Sea Containers**_][1]--**which used to be an office buildingThey vary from keeping the shell of the building, whilst developing a new interior, to others which adapt the existing framework, such as the Malmaison Hotel in Oxford.

## New Builds

# This is probably the easiest category to explain. These are hotels which are completely new constructions. They may be the building in its entirety or may have a number of floors within the building. An example of the latter is the [_**Shangri-La in the Shard in London**_][2].There are a number of instances where the hotel is an entirely new build but is on the site of a previous property. I have treated these as totally new builds as the infrastructure is completely new.

## Rebrandings

# 

This is an area of fascination to me.  Here it is very easy to see how the various PR / Hotel  groups position their properties.

This group covers a number of sub-groups:

* **Becoming Independent**

The hotel owner(s) / management company take the decision to no longer market the hotel with a recognisable brand - e.g. [Hotel du Collectioneur][3] (Previously Hilton Arc De Triomphe Paris)

* **Change of Brand**

The hotel owner(s) / management company take the decision to change the branding of the property.  This may be a different brand within a hotel group or as is more frequently the case, they select a brand from another group to market the hotel. Often this re-branding also requires a degree of refurbishment in order to meet the new brand standards - e.g. [AC Hotel Nic][4]e  (Previously Four Points By Sheraton Elys√©e Palace)

* **Joining a Brand**

The hotel owner(s) / Management company feel that the hotel can gain better marketing by joining a recognised Hotel Group / Brand e.g. [Four Seasons Hotel Moscow][5] (Previously Hotel Moskva)

* **New Representation**

Independent hotels, in order to improve their international representation and also gain access to technology, such as GDS connectivity will often sign up to a new representation company,   e.g. Alexander Hotel Dublin (now represented by Great Hotels of the World)

* **Splitting   **This is a more recent scenario, which has seen a number of existing hotels, being rebranded and also split into 2 brands from a hotel group.

E.g. [Clarion Hotel Downtown Columbia SC][6] becoming in 2016

* Home2Suites by Hilton Columbia
* Hilton Garden Inn Columbia

* **Combining    **This is a more recent scenario, which has seen a number of existing hotels being combined in a single property.  This is generally a rarer occurrence and seems to happen when the owners of several connected buildings being combined into a single larger property.

## Other Hotel Announcements

# This category is the "catch-all " bucket for the hotels which have been publicised as being new, but I have not been able to ascertain into which of the above groupings.

The above tables are a summary of the information I have collated. Some of the 2015 hotels which are captured as being open may have been delayed and end up opening in 2016.Also to consider that at least 2 hotels are having their status revised. The Address in Dubai is now "closed", due to the fire on New Year's Eve and the most recent news of the fire at the[Ritz Hotel in Paris][7], which has had a fire in the upper floor and roof space. This is likely to delay the opening of the hotel.
