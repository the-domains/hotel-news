Tracking changes in the Hospitality Industry is hard work, but it has been fascinating and helped to improve my understanding the challenges going forward.

So far this year, I have been updating the data tracking that I have and would like to share some of the information.

**Conversion of Hotels**

These are buildings which have served a previous use and are now being converted into hotels. It is good to see that buildings can be re-purposed:

* 2014 - 52 hotels were due to be opened 
* 2015 - 120 hotels
* 2016 - 69 hotels have been identified already for 2016 

Europe is leading the way in the process of re-purposing the buildings, it may have something to do with more "historic" buildings which are "protected".

**New Builds**

These hotels are completely new builds, some though are replacing previous hotels.

* 2014 - 671 
* 2015 - 1,210
* 2016 - 912

It would seem that either my tracking for 2014 was incomplete or equally likely there was a hiatus in the building of hotels.

It would seem that the Americas as a whole is the region to be in for construction work. I am tracking an almost 50% of new hotels in the region.

**Re-branding**

Here is the "fun" part of hotel news and information. Some sites refer to these hotels as conversions. Whilst I can understand the logic of the category as frequently these hotels have to undergo some refurbishment and remodelling in order to meet the new brand standards.

This area falls into 3 basic subsets:

* From Independent to branded property
* Branded to independepent
* Change of Brands

Possibly some clarification may be needed here especially with regards to definitions:

Again whilst we can expect disagreement as to how to label these definitions, the approach I have taken is as follows:

Hotel Group: I have chosen to create a label which allows for information to better summarised. A Hotel Group is the overarching group which operates, franchises or otherwise generally markets a range of properties.

The Groups operate either a single brand or a number of brands covering a range and type of hotels. In the 2nd group we have a lot of Groups, but the most widely known and recognisable are, in no particular order:

* Magnuson Hotels
* Accor Hotels
* Best Western
* Starwood Hotels & Resorts
* Intercontinental Hotels
* Marriott
* Choice Hotels
* Hilton
* Four Seasons
* Shangri-La
* Hyatt
* La Quinta
* Millennium Hotels & Resorts

Changes in branding:

* 2014 - 583
* 2015 - 739
* 2016 - 338

All in all, the number of changes/additions in  hotels over the 2+year period is just over 6000 and that is just the one I can track.

If anyone has any hotel news they would like to share then please let me know.
