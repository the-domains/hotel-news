## Welcome to 2016\.

I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a Happy New Year 2016 and hope that it brings you all health and happiness.

### Data Breach - Hyatt

We start the new year with some more news relating to Card Data Security issues. [Hyatt Card Breach][0] has been the unfortunate victim of a card breach.

They advise that they were a victim of software on their payment systems. Sadly this is not the [first breach of hoteliers][1].

Hyatt has provided a [website][1] that gives contact details if guests have any questions regarding this data breach.

As on the related blog, it would be wise to double check all the card transactions on your credit card if you have stayed in any Hyatt. Whilst the "notice" of the data breach relates to the properties that are "managed" by Hyatt, as this information is not generally available to the public. Please****

**Please check you bank statements!**

### The Address Dubai - New Year's Eve

In the run to the New Year's Eve celebrations in Dubai, there was a spectacular fire at [The Address Dubai][2]. Fortunately, due to timing and prompt response from the Dubai Civil Defence authorities, hotel staff and guests, we had very few casualties.

[Emaar][3]- the owners of the property have already appointed [contractors][4] to assess the work required to refurbish the hotel and re-open the property as quickly as possible.

In the coming series of post, I will provide some analysis of the changes which have taken place in the hospitality during 2015 and also have a look at the coming events during 2016\.

These will include changes in structure and organisation following the mergers of:

1. Marriott and Starwood
2. Accor and FRHI

Branding changes have already been identified for 2016, with Centara Hotels & Resorts rebranding to [Centara Hospitality International][5].
