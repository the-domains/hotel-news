## Another month - another set of New Brand Launches

We are completing another month and we have a set of announcements relating to the launching of new brands within the hotel industry.

## [Fairfield by Marriott][0]

Marriott International and Eastern Crown Hotels Group have today announced the signing of an agreement for the development of hotels within the Chinese Market.

They are intending to develop some 140 over the next 5 years with over 100 being operational by 2021\. These hotels will operate under Fairfield by Marriott brand. The introduction of this brand will represent the 10th "Marriott" brand to operate in the Chinese Market. There are currently some 80 hotels operating in the Chinese Market and these new developments will more than double the number of hotels under the Marriott Flags. This does not take into account the Starwood Brands currently operating in China.

## [Prem Group][1]

Prem Group has today announced the development of 2 new sub-brands. They will be

* [Premier Suites][2]
* Premier Suites Plus

## [L.E. Hotels Debuts Luxe Collection][3]

L.E. Hotels Debuts [Luxe Collection][4]

L.E. Hotels has joined the list of hotel groups launching new brands. Under this brand, L.E. Hotels have hotels in:

* 10 European Locations
* 6 Americas
* 2 Asia Pacific

## [WoodSpring Suites Signature][5]

Woodspring Hotels who offer Woodspring Suites and Value Place Brands to the market are launching an additional brand:

**Woodspring Suites Signature**- name of the new extension targeted to mid-priced, extended-stay travelers who typically stay for weeks at a time and want higher service levels.

Though it seems that the Value Place brand will disappear from the marketplace as the existing properties are in the processes of being rebranded.

The ongoing development of New Brands seems to be endless, despite the forthcoming mergers of [Marriott / Starwood and Accor/FRHI][6]. These new additions brings to 5 the new brands which have been "launched " in 2016\.

If anyone has any news on further brand developments I would be more than happy to share with my loyal followers.

Thank you for reading.
