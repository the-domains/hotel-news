* Yotel

These properties will be the "urban hotels" with room size of 13.5 square meters to 22 square meters, but on average 16.5 square meters. "That's really enough, but we have to be flexible because of the different building codes in different cities.

* Yotel "Serviced Apartments" Brand

The precise experience that this will offer is still under development, but has been described as - "The serviced-apartment product is inspired by our cabins but will be more spacious and residential."
