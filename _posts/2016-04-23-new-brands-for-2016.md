# New Brands for 2016

We start the New Year with the announcement of 2 New Hotels Brands.

## FRHI Hotels & Resorts

FRHI have announced the creation of a new lifestyle brand for Today's Chinese Traveller.

The new brand will be a joint venture with **Jiangsu Golden Land Group**with the first hotel to be branded being located in Shanghai's Xuhui District.

The new brand is [NEQTA Hotels][0].

## Hilton Worldwide

Hilton Worldwide have developed a new Mid-Market brand which they have just launched.

[Tru by Hilton][1]

The[press release][2]indicates that they have some 102 signed deals already in place with a number of further hotels being discussed.

## [Brand Shuffle][3]

This is the start of the 2016 Brand shuffle.

## Accor buys FRHI

With Accor Hotels having agreed to by FRHI Hotels & Resorts, there will no doubt be a reshuffle of the brand positioning.

## Marriott buying Starwood

With Marriott finalising the purchase of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, I can see a possible re-positioning of 1 or several of the brands as there is a degree of overlap between the overall portfolios.
